Lets get started with setting up version control and starting the project.

##### `Step 1.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond:

Click on the **[GitHub Classroom Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/zDQ4NVnj)** if you want a repository to use for the game. Press the <kbd>Accept this assignment</kbd> button.

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

You will now be sent to a message that says the repository is being configured.  Wait a few seconds then press the refresh button.

##### `Step 3.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Eventually you will get a link to the repository that **GitHub Classroom** has created.  *Click* on the link to your new repository.

![press link to repository](images/linkToRepository.png)

##### `Step 4.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now I have created a projet for you to start with.  This is a **Blank GML** projet that is called `TopDownShooter`.  Notice that the **README.md** file is displayed on your repository front page.  We also have the folder and all the files for an empty project.

##### `Step 5.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond:

Press the **Pencil** icon next to the **README.md** file to edit this file.  Change it to your name and please add feedback to this as you go along.

##### `Step 6.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

I allow you to use all the assets and scritps that I have created over the years to you own liking.  I publish them with the MIT open source license.  If you want to repricate you can leave this license alone.  This means that you are releasing your work as open source.  If you do not want this please change the LICENSE to one that you would like to use. More information can be found on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).

##### `Step 7.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

This `.gitignore` file tells GitHub which files to not upload and sync with the project.  In this case the only file we do not need at the hidden `.DS_Store` files that macs create.  You can leave this file alone as it will not do anyting on a PC.

##### `Step 8.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Press the green <kbd>Code</kbd> button and select **Open With GitHub Desktop**.

##### `Step 9.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Select a directory to save the project to (DO NOT SAVE TO ONE DRIVE!).

![create new repository in project folder](images/pickDirectoryClone.png)

Now the only way we know that it works properly is to turn on the ability to see hidden files and folders.  Go to [Microsoft Resources](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2) for windows 10 instructions for turning on hidden files and folders.  Read this [article](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/show-hidden-files-mac-3520878/) for instructions on the mac.

##### `Step 10.`\|`SPCRK`| :large_blue_diamond:

You now need to connect this new repository to the one you created in the second step in this walk through.  Copy and paste the line that includes `git remote add origin`... and press enter.

![add origin for github repository](images/setRemoteGitHub.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 11.`\|`SPCRK`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Now type `git push -u origin main` to push your work to **GitHub**.  The project is now set up and you will be able to use **GitHub** desktop without command line for the rest of the project.
